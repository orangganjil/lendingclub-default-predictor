# Lending Club Predictor Supporting Files

These are some supporting, non-essential files I am including for documentation purposes. These files are the script I used to clean and prepare the data from LendingClub, as well as the script used to build the model for use in the predictor.

I have not included my various data exploration scripts and model evaluation attempts. I tried multiple variations of models before settling on the Random Forest Classifier. Rather than include all of the evaluation scripts, I have only included the one for building the RFC.
